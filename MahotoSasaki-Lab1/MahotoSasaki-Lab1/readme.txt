CREATIVE PORTION
1. What you implemented?
I implemented a button that shows the user a list of states in the U.S.A including the District of Columbia. Each state is associated to a sales tax obtained from the January 1, 2020 tax data.

2. How you implemented it?
I implemented it by displaying a UIPickerView and UIButton when clicking on the "Select State" button. Every time the user selects a state in the UIPickerView, the UITextField associated with the "Sales Tax %" is altered to the sales tax associated with the chosen state in the UIPickerView. The sales tax data was manually created for each state.

3. Why you implemented it?
I implemented this because I felt that it would be more convenient for a person to calculate their shopping cost if they do not know the exact sales tax % of their state. This feature allows the user to avoid the hassle of going to the internet to find the exact figure and enables the user to complete everything within their app.
